# ### Problem One
# [lab7:prob:staggered]:(#Problem-One) 
# > Modify *rain.py* to solve this problem (Simple
# equations on a staggered grid). Submit your code and a final plot for
# one case.

#
# %% [markdown]
# ### Problem Two 
# [lab7:prob:stability]:(#Problem-Two)
# > a) Find the CFL condition (in seconds) for $dt$
# for the Python example in ProblemÂ One.
# <!--- [lab7:prob:staggered]---> Test your
# value. 
#
# > b) Find the CFL condition (in seconds) for $dt$ for the Python
# example in *rain.py*, ie., for the non-staggered grid. Test your value.
